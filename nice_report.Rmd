## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A plot of the tire pressure...?"}
plot(pressure)
```

## Including equations

Here is an example of an equation over two lines.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_0 = i_0, \dots X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, X_n = i_n) \\
&= P(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Including tables
We can use `kable()` to generate tables from R output very easily. Here is a centered booktabs-style table with a caption. 

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
some_cars <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
kable(some_cars, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "A table of some car data.") |> 
    kable_styling(position = "center")
```

## Using `ggplot2` in Rmarkdown


```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load some packages. The package showtext prints some messages when you load it, and this doesn't look very nice in the report, so we write message = FALSE.
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(showtext)
showtext_auto()
font_add_google(name = "Josefin Sans", family = "Josefin Sans")
```

We make a simple figure from the penguin data. Notice that we use the option `warning = FALSE`, because `ggplot2` prints some warnings because there are some missing values in the data. This isn't a problem here, and the warnings look ugly in our report, so we remove them.

```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.cap="The Palmer penguin figure from the slides, an example of plotting in ggplot2. This version is the most simple version, using default themes and colors."}
ggplot(data = penguins,  # Add the data
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + # Map the x and y axis to the respective variables
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) # Add points, and map the color to the penguin species
```


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.cap="The Palmer penguin figure from the slides, an example of plotting in ggplot2. In this version we have changed the theme, colors and font, and moved the legend to the top."}
ggplot(data = penguins,  # Add the data
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + # Map the x and y axis to the respective variables
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) + # Add points, and map the color to the penguin species
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange", "darkcyan", "hotpink")) + # Change the default colors
  labs( # Change labels in the plot
    color = "Species", # Change the legend title
    x = "Body mass (g)", y = "Flipper length (mm)") + # Change the axis titles
  theme_bw() + # Use a different theme
  theme( # Customize the theme
    legend.position = "top", # Move the legend to the top
    text = element_text(family = "Josefin Sans")) # Change the font
```
